                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p><strong> Einstein </strong>(14 March 1879-18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing<em>the theory of relativity</em> , Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass-energy equivalence formula <strong>E = mc^2</strong>, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics <em>"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"</em>, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
